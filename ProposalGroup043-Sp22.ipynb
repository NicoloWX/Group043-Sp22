    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to predict the popularity of a new track taking features such as artists, danceability and duration etc. by generating a model based on supervised machine learning algorithms. The data we choose to use is a dataset which contains audio and other features of more than 600,000 tracks extracted from spotify. It is a representation of all songs from different countries and genres in the current music industry from 1921 to 2022. We plan to first standardize features like duration, numbers of followers of the artists and date. Then we would take a close look at the features through EDA to determine further data preprocessing procedure of the dataset. Next step is to create a baseline model using linear regression with dancibility as the sole predictive parameter. In order to generate a high- accuracy model, we would use different supervised algorithms like SVR, random forest regressor and LASSO regression with engineered features and measure their performances using different metrics such as $R^2$ and MSE. We strive for a higher $R^2$ score and a lower MSE. We will also incorporate cross validation for tuning the hyperparameters. At the end, We plan to generate a simple neural network using keras to see whether this gives us higher accuracy.      "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Music has always been an important component of the entertainment industry. The emergence of pop music began with songs and pieces available as digital sound files. People's orientation to music has evolved with time, from country and rock of “the good old days”  to electronic and hip-hop styles that are nowadays popular. A variety of factors can determine the popularity of a track. Rhythm and lyrics are some of the most important features in determining the popularity as well as other features like the producer, energy and release date. Our goal is to predict the popularity<a name=\"ref_1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference_1) of the track once it is released based on basic features of the track. Other data scientists have tried to use only the audio feature of the song itself to predict its popularity<a name=\"ref_2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#reference_2). While they used primarily audio features to train their model, we have decided to tackle the problem from a different perspective, incorporating features such as the producer, the number of followers the artist has and the name of the track. We believe that our model enables us to predict the popularity of the track more effectively, i.e. without the need to listen to the whole track."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at the dataset, we find an interesting column called <b>popularity</b>. Based on the description from the source of the data(Kaggle), this column measures how popular the track is in a range of 0 to 100. We intend to understand how the values in the popularity column are obtained. More specifically, given other columns such as energy, danceability and #_followers, can we predict the popularity of the track? Additionally, based on domain knowledge, are there any other interesting features that we can engineer in order to improve our predictions? It is clear that we have a regression problem here since the predicted values are continuous. If we take linear regression as an example, this problem can be expressed as  $popularity=w_0+w_1x_1+...+w_dx_d$ where $x_i$'s are features to be determined. Therefore our goal is to fit the best regression model with appropriate features in order to improve our prediction accuracy on popularity. "

Our data contains only generalized statistics about artists and their track’s popularity, genre, etc. None of these values have identifiable information that can be traced back to individual Spotify users. Since the datasets were collected from the official spotify web api with over 600 thousands tracks and more than one million artists, we assumed that potential bias in the data collection is kept to a minimum. \n",
